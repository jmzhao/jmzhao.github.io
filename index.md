I am an applied scientist at Amazon. 
Before that, I was [a PhD student](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jz/) at University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Before that, I was an undergrad at Nanjing University.

My research interest lies in the intersection of machine learning, programming language and natural language. 
Some of the topics I specifically interested in are machine learning for code, word embedding and language models, efficient training of (dynamic) neural nets, and interpretability of deep learning models.

This site is under construction. Expect more to come in the future. I would also like to start sharing my thoughts and ideas in forms of blog posts.
